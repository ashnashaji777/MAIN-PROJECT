AIR WRITING CHARACTER RECOGNITION 
This project presents an air writing recognition system that utilizes computer vision techniques in conjunction with machine learning models. 
The system employs the Mediapipe library for real-time hand detection and tracking, enabling users to write characters in the air.
Hand landmarks are extracted from the detected hands, which serve as input for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. 
The CNN is trained to recognize and classify the air-written characters based on the captured hand movements.
By combining computer vision for gesture interpretation and CNN for character recognition, the system achieves accurate recognition of air-written characters,
demonstrating the effective integration of computer vision and machine learning in a practical application scenario.
